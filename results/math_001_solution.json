Factory A produces 100 widgets/day, Factory B produces 150 widgets/day, and Factory C produces 200 widgets/day. If the company needs to produce 10,000 widgets in the minimum number of days, how should they allocate production?\n\n[16:36:16] Problem Analyst (analyst_01) -> TOPIC[problem_breakdown] -> [specialist_01, analyst_01, coordinator_01]:\n**Problem Analysis**\n\nTo determine the optimal allocation of production, we need to calculate the total production capacity of the three factories and then find the combination that meets the target production of 10,000 widgets in the minimum number of days.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Production Capacity**\n\nFactory A: 100 widgets/day\nFactory B: 150 widgets/day\nFactory C: 200 widgets/day\n\nTotal production capacity = 100 + 150 + 200 = 450 widgets/day\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Minimum Number of Days Required**\n\nTo find the minimum number of days required to produce 10,000 widgets, we divide the target production by the total production capacity:\n\nMinimum number of days = 10,000 widgets / 450 widgets/day ≈ 22.22 days\n\nSince we cannot have a fraction of a day, we round up to the nearest whole number to ensure we meet the target production.\n\n**Step 3: Allocate Production**\n\nTo allocate production, we need to find the combination of factory production rates that meets the target production in the minimum number of days. We can use a linear programming approach or a simple trial-and-error method.\n\nLet's assume the allocation is x widgets/day for Factory A, y widgets/day for Factory B, and z widgets/day for Factory C.\n\nWe want to minimize the number of days while meeting the target production:\n\nx + y + z = 450 (total production capacity)\nx + y + z ≥ 10,000 (target production)\n\nSince we want to minimize the number of days, we can try different combinations of x, y, and z that meet the target production.\n\n**Optimal Allocation**\n\nAfter analyzing different combinations, we find that the optimal allocation is:\n\nFactory A: 0 widgets/day (not used)\nFactory B: 150 widgets/day\nFactory C: 200 widgets/day\n\nThis allocation meets the target production of 10,000 widgets in 22 days.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe company should allocate production as follows:\n\n* Factory B: 150 widgets/day\n* Factory C: 200 widgets/day\n\nThis allocation will meet the target production of 10,000 widgets in the minimum number of days, which is 22 days.\n\n[16:36:18] Team Coordinator (coordinator_01) -> TOPIC[coordination] -> [specialist_01, analyst_01, coordinator_01, implementer_01]:\n**Next Steps:**\n\nBased on the analysis provided, we have determined the optimal allocation of production to meet the target production of 10,000 widgets in the minimum number of days. However, we can further refine the solution by considering the following:\n\n1. **Verify the Optimal Allocation:** We should verify that the allocation of 0 widgets/day for Factory A, 150 widgets/day for Factory B, and 200 widgets/day for Factory C indeed meets the target production of 10,000 widgets in 22 days.\n2. **Explore Alternative Scenarios:** We can explore alternative scenarios by adjusting the allocation of production among the three factories. For example, we can try allocating 50 widgets/day to Factory A and 200 widgets/day to Factory C, while keeping the allocation for Factory B at 150 widgets/day.\n3. **Consider Production Constraints:** We should consider any production constraints that may affect the allocation of production. For example, are there any limitations on the number of widgets that can be produced per day at each factory?\n4. **Develop a Production Plan:** Once we have finalized the optimal allocation of production, we should develop a production plan that outlines the specific production targets for each factory, as well as the resources and personnel required to meet those targets.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1.
