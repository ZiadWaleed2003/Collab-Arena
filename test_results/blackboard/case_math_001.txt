PROBLEM:
A company has 3 factories producing widgets. Factory A produces 100 widgets/day, Factory B produces 150 widgets/day, and Factory C produces 200 widgets/day. If the company needs to produce 10,000 widgets in the minimum number of days, how should they allocate production?

Topic: optimization
Content: [Problem Analyst]: To minimize the number of days required to produce 10,000 widgets, the company should operate **all three factories simultaneously**. 

**Key Steps:**
1. **Combined Daily Production:**  
   Factory A (100/day) + Factory B (150/day) + Factory C (200/day) = **450 widgets/day**.

2. **Minimum Days Calculation:**  
   Total widgets needed / Combined daily rate = $ \frac{10,000}{450} \approx 22.22 $ days.

3. **Allocation:**  
   Each factory operates for **22.22 days**, producing:  
   - Factory A: $ 100 \times 22.22 = 2,222.22 $ widgets  
   - Factory B: $ 150 \times 22.22 = 3,333.33 $ widgets  
   - Factory C: $ 200 \times 22.22 = 4,444.44 $ widgets  
   Total: $ 2,222.22 + 3,333.33 + 4,444.44 = 10,000 $ widgets.

**Conclusion:**  
The minimum number of days required is **22.22 days**, with all factories working concurrently. This ensures the highest combined output and minimizes idle time. If fractional days are not feasible, rounding up to **23 days** would be necessary, but the optimal solution assumes continuous operation. 

**Answer:**  
Allocate production so that all factories operate simultaneously for $ \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22 $ days, producing approximately 2,222, 3,333, and 4,444 widgets at A, B, and C respectively.

Content: [Domain Specialist]: To minimize the number of days required to produce 10,000 widgets, the company should operate **all three factories simultaneously**. Here's the concise breakdown:

1. **Combined Daily Production Rate:**  
   - Factory A: 100 widgets/day  
   - Factory B: 150 widgets/day  
   - Factory C: 200 widgets/day  
   **Total**: $ 100 + 150 + 200 = 450 $ widgets/day.  

2. **Minimum Days Calculation:**  
   $ \text{Days} = \frac{10,000}{450} = \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22 $ days.  

3. **Allocation of Production:**  
   - **Factory A**: $ 100 \times \frac{200}{9} \approx 2,222.22 $ widgets  
   - **Factory B**: $ 150 \times \frac{200}{9} \approx 3,333.33 $ widgets  
   - **Factory C**: $ 200 \times \frac{200}{9} \approx 4,444.44 $ widgets  
   **Total**: $ 2,222.22 + 3,333.33 + 4,444.44 = 10,000 $ widgets.  

4. **Key Insight:**  
   Running all factories concurrently maximizes the daily output (450 widgets/day), ensuring the fastest completion. Any alternative allocation (e.g., idling one factory) would reduce the daily rate, increasing the required days.  

5. **Practical Consideration:**  
   If fractional days are infeasible, round up to **23 days**, resulting in a surplus of $ 450 \times 23 = 10,350 $ widgets. However, the mathematically optimal solution assumes continuous operation for $ \frac{200}{9} $ days.  

**Answer:** Operate all factories simultaneously for $ \frac{200}{9} \approx 22.22 $ days, producing approximately 2,222, 3,333, and 4,444 widgets at A, B, and C respectively. This minimizes the time to 22.22 days.
